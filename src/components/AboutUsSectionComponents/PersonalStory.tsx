        With over 3 years of experience in web development, I specialize in
        creating custom websites that help businesses grow online. I started my
        journey with traditional web technologies and have evolved to focus on
        modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Gatsby.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
        I understand the unique challenges that businesses face in the Dominican
        Republic and Latin America. That's why I create websites that are not
        only beautiful and functional but also optimized for local search and
        designed to convert visitors into customers.
